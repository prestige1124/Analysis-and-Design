# Analysis-and-Design

The main problem represented over this course was how to effectively choose and integrate a data structure best suited for the task. Using algorithm sets, I was able to implement code to read CSV and TXT files. Dependent on the data structure; I was also able to add,delete or search for files on the user end. Writing pseudocode as a road map helped immensely when developing the code.

The method I used to approach the problems was how the information needed to be sorted and used when called upon. Understanding which data structure allows for searching/removing helped me choose which structure to use.

The largest roadblock I encountered was creating code that opened an external file. A few times it was how I added the file to the explore; others was the call function. After the first few assignments; I understood a bit more with the initial token size for the file. A particular debugging error caused the prerequisites to crash when printing CSCI101 only. 

This course expanded on pseudocode and how data structures can manipulate the files at hand. A simple search engine to locate a file can reduce the redundancies when creating the application. A vector structure will be better suited than a binary tree for faster results with less effort. The last project required less lines of code than I initially thought with only a few errors when debugging. 

The prior course reflected on design templates and the workflow of  the applications code; as compared to this course which elaborated on the pseudocode to greater detail. Coding has become easier over time as most skills do but the adaptability has improved the greatest. Switching across C++, Java and Pythin has exposed me to different approachs to create the same result.
